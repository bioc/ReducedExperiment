\title{Get common factor features}
\usage{
get_common_features(factor_features)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor_features}{A \code{data.frame} as returned by
\link[ReducedExperiment]{getAlignedFeatures}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} for each factor pair with the numbers and proportions
of the genes in the input that overlap.
}
\description{
Function to count how many genes are aligned with multiple factors.
}
\examples{
# Get a random matrix with rnorm, with 100 rows (features)
# and 20 columns (observations)
X <- ReducedExperiment:::.makeRandomData(100, 20, "feature", "obs")

# Estimate 5 factors based on the data matrix
fe <- estimate_factors(X, nc = 5)

# Get the genes highly aligned with each factor
aligned_features <- getAlignedFeatures(
    fe,
    format = "data.frame",
    proportional_threshold = 0.3
)

# Identify overlap between common features for each factor
common_features <- get_common_features(aligned_features)
head(common_features)
