ReducedExperiment provides SummarizedExperiment-like containers for
storing and manipulating dimensionally-reduced assay data. The
ReducedExperiment classes allow users to simultaneously manipulate their
original dataset and their decomposed data, in addition to other
method-specific outputs like feature loadings. Implements utilities and
specialised classes for the application of stabilised independent
component analysis (sICA) and weighted gene correlation network analysis
(WGCNA).

## Installation

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `ReducedExperiment`
from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("ReducedExperiment")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jackgisby/ReducedExperiment) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jackgisby/ReducedExperiment")
```

The development version of the package is also available as a container
on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jackgisby/reducedexperiment/).

## Usage

`ReducedExperiment` objects are derived from `SummarizedExperiment`
objects, with additional slots designed to store and manipulate the
outputs of common dimensionality reduction techniques.

As an example, the `SummarizedExperiment` described below contains gene
expression data from individuals with COVID-19. It contains the
following slots: - `assays` - A features by samples matrix containing
the expression data. - `colData` - Contains a row for each sample
containing phenotype data. - `rowData` - Contains a row for each feature
containing gene IDs.

The `SummarizedExperiment` objects are convenient because, when we slice
the rows or columns of the expression matrix, the metadata for the rows
and columns are sliced accordingly.

``` r
library("SummarizedExperiment")

se
#> class: SummarizedExperiment 
#> dim: 2184 234 
#> metadata(0):
#> assays(1): normal
#> rownames(2184): ENSG00000002587 ENSG00000002726 ... ENSG00000288600
#>   ENSG00000288700
#> rowData names(3): gencode_id ensembl_id gene_id
#> colnames(234): C10_positive_18 C10_positive_21 ... C99_positive_13
#>   C99_positive_16
#> colData names(19): sample_id individual_id ...
#>   time_from_first_positive_swab time_from_first_x
```

The `SummarizedExperiment` has two dimensions, representing the features
(2,184) and samples (234).

We can perform a factor analysis on these data, the result of which is a
set of reduced components and feature loadings.

``` r
library("ReducedExperiment")

fe <- estimate_factors(se, nc = 35)

fe
#> class: FactorisedExperiment 
#> dim: 2184 234 35 
#> metadata(0):
#> assays(2): normal transformed
#> rownames(2184): ENSG00000002587 ENSG00000002726 ... ENSG00000288600
#>   ENSG00000288700
#> rowData names(3): gencode_id ensembl_id gene_id
#> colnames(234): C10_positive_18 C10_positive_21 ... C99_positive_13
#>   C99_positive_16
#> colData names(19): sample_id individual_id ...
#>   time_from_first_positive_swab time_from_first_x
#> 35 components
```

This `FactorisedExperiment` object has an additional dimension
representing the 35 factors. It also has additional slots, including: -
`reduced` - A samples by factors matrix containing the
dimensionally-reduced data. - `loadings` - Contains a features by
factors matrix containing the loadings.

The `ReducedExperiment` objects allow users to simultaneously slice and
modify the `assays`, `rowData`, `colData`, `reduced` and `loadings`
matrices. Here, we provided a `SummarizedExperiment` object to
`estimate_factors`, but we could just have easily provided a simple
expression matrix.

## Functionality

The package currently provides three types of container: -
`ReducedExperiment` - A basic container that can store
dimensionally-reduced components. - `FactorisedExperiment` - A container
based on `ReducedExperiment` designed for working with the results of
factor analysis. It can contain feature loadings and factor stability
values. - `ModularExperiment` - A container based on `ReducedExperiment`
designed for working with modules of features (usually genes), as is
produced by the popular Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis
(WGCNA) approach. It contains the mapping of features to modules

Various tools are provided by the package for applying dimensionality
reduction and manipulating their results. These include: - Workflows for
applying independent component analysis (ICA) and WGCNA. We additionally
developed an R implementation of the stabilised ICA algorithm. - Methods
for applying pathway enrichment analysis to factors and modules. -
Functions for identifying associations between factors/modules and
sample-level variables. - Methods for applying identified factors or
modules to new datasets. - Other approach-specific plots and utilities,
such as factor stability plots and module preservation plots.

Many of these are demonstrated in more detail in the [packageâ€™s
vignette](https://jackgisby.github.io/ReducedExperiment/articles/ReducedExperiment.html).

The containers implemented in `ReducedExperiment` are designed to be
extensible. We encourage the development of children classes with
additional, or alternative, slots and methods.
