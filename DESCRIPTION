Description: Provides SummarizedExperiment-like containers for storing and
    manipulating dimensionally-reduced assay data. The ReducedExperiment
    classes allow users to simultaneously manipulate their original dataset
    and their decomposed data, in addition to other method-specific outputs
    like feature loadings. Implements utilities and specialised classes for the 
    application of stabilised independent component analysis (sICA) and 
    weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
